      <h1>The Palo Alto Promise</h1>
      <p>
        We like to travel, be outdoors, experience the entire globe and to do
        that, well, we needed a pack on our back at all times. And we decided to
        make them, with some of the most awesome, talented people we could find.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our adventure began, we were about to embark on a journey we could never
        even imagine. In a territory unknown to us we felt energized, excited...
        and well, scared. Could we really pull this off? Could we revolutionize
        bags? With the unknown in hand, we set out to discover impeccable
        materials, innovative technique and a desire to take bags to new
        mountain tops.
      </p>
      <p>
        We quickly fell in love with the process and more importantly with the
        stories behind each person carrying our pack, traveling the world with
        Topos. A huge thanks to all those who support us and believe in us.
        Happy trails.
